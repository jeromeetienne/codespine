# ts_knowledge_graph

Parse TypeScript source code into a **knowledge graph**, then use that graph as
the substrate for an autonomous AI agent that finds and applies code
optimizations.

## Documentation

Full documentation lives in [`./docs`](docs/INDEX.md). The
[documentation index](docs/INDEX.md) describes every guide and command — start
there, or jump straight to [Getting Started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Why a graph

An optimization agent constantly needs to reason about *blast radius*:

- *If I rewrite this function, who calls it and what breaks?* — `CALLS` edges
- *Is this export dead code I can delete?* — cross-file reference resolution
- *What is affected if I change this type?* — `USES_TYPE` / type-checker edges

These questions require **semantic** parsing (symbol + type resolution), which is
why the extractor is built on [`ts-morph`](https://ts-morph.com) (the TypeScript
Compiler API) rather than a syntax-only parser.

## Graph model

**Nodes** — `Module`, `Class`, `Interface`, `TypeAlias`, `Enum`, `Function`,
`Method`, `Property`, `Parameter`, `Variable`, `ExternalModule`, and the
system-level `ConfigFlag` (environment variables), `ExternalAPI` (outbound HTTP
hosts), and `Endpoint` (HTTP routes).

**Edges**

| Layer | Edges |
| --- | --- |
| Structural | `CONTAINS`, `IMPORTS`, `EXPORTS` |
| Type | `EXTENDS`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `USES_TYPE`, `RETURNS`, `PARAM_TYPE` |
| Behavioral | `CALLS`, `INSTANTIATES`, `OVERRIDES`, `READS`, `WRITES` |
| System-level | `READS_CONFIG`, `CALLS_EXTERNAL`, `HANDLES` |
| Runtime | `CALLS_RUNTIME` |

The structural layer — plus the always-on config and outbound-HTTP surfaces
(`ConfigFlag` / `READS_CONFIG`, `ExternalAPI` / `CALLS_EXTERNAL`) — is cheap and
needs no symbol resolution. The type, behavioral, and endpoint (`Endpoint` /
`HANDLES`) layers require symbol resolution and are emitted with `--semantic`. The
runtime layer (`CALLS_RUNTIME`) is reconstructed from a CPU profile's call tree by
[`enrich`](docs/commands/enrich.md), not parsed from source — the calls that
actually fired, dynamic dispatch included.

`ConfigFlag` nodes come from `process.env.X` reads; `ExternalAPI` nodes from
`fetch(...)` call sites (one per host); `Endpoint` nodes from route registrations
like `app.get('/users', handler)`, each with a `HANDLES` edge to the handler
function. These are the system-level kinds tracked in
[#31](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/ts_knowledge_graph/issues/31).

## Usage

```bash
npm install

# structural graph only (fast)
npm run extract -- <path-to-project>

# full graph with heritage + CALLS edges
npm run extract -- <path-to-project> --semantic
```

Output is two JSONL files — `.ts_knowledge_graph/graph/nodes.jsonl` and
`.ts_knowledge_graph/graph/edges.jsonl` (override the base folder with `-o, --output-folder`)
— one record per line, easy to inspect, diff, and load into any store.

### Querying the graph

Load the JSONL into an embedded [Kùzu](https://kuzudb.com) database, then run the
query tools:

```bash
npm run dev -- load        # reads ./.ts_knowledge_graph/graph, writes ./.ts_knowledge_graph/graph.kuzu

npm run dev -- find <name>                 # resolve a name to node ids
npm run dev -- who-calls <id>              # direct callers of a symbol
npm run dev -- calls <id>                  # what a symbol calls
npm run dev -- blast-radius <id> --depth 10  # transitive callers (impact set)
npm run dev -- references <id>             # everything that references a symbol/type
npm run dev -- dead-exports                # exported symbols with no inbound refs
npm run dev -- neighbors <id>              # one-hop neighbourhood (in + out)
npm run dev -- hotspots --by self-time     # rank nodes by optimization leverage
npm run dev -- cost                        # inclusive cost + share-of-total (causal)
npm run dev -- cost <id>                    # where one node's cost goes / who causes it
npm run dev -- cluster                      # detect code communities (Leiden) -> metadata.community
npm run dev -- campaign                     # ranked optimization worklist (safe removals + hotspots)
```

Every query command accepts `--json` to emit machine-readable output — this is
the shape the optimization agent consumes. Node ids come from `find` or another
query's results; do not hand-write them.

The query methods on `GraphQuery` (`whoCalls`, `blastRadius`, `deadExports`,
`hotspots`, `costRanking`, `costAttribution`, `neighborhood`, …) are designed to
map one-to-one onto agent tools: JSON in, JSON out.

For a task-oriented walk-through of these commands — using them by hand to
answer impact, dead-code, and dependency questions — see the
[Static Analysis guide](docs/STATIC_ANALYSIS.md).

> **`dead-exports` accuracy:** it is member-aware (a class/interface counts as
> live when any contained member is referenced) and considers `CALLS`,
> `EXTENDS`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `USES_TYPE`, `RETURNS`, `PARAM_TYPE`, `INSTANTIATES`,
> and `READS` (value-identifier) edges. On this repository it reports exactly the
> two genuinely-unused type aliases — no false positives.

### Web visualisation

Serve the database as an interactive graph — pan/zoom, kind filters, symbol
search, per-node edge listing (see
[contribs/webview](contribs/webview)):

```bash
npm run webview            # reads ./.ts_knowledge_graph/graph.kuzu, serves http://localhost:4173
npm run webview -- -o ./.ts_knowledge_graph --port 8080
```

### The optimization agent

The end goal: an agent that uses the graph to find and apply optimizations,
verifying each one before keeping it. It ships as a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
slash command, `/code-graph-optimize`, defined in
[`dotclaude_folder/commands/code-graph-optimize.md`](dotclaude_folder/commands/code-graph-optimize.md)
— so the agent runtime is your Claude Code subscription, with no API key or
provider configuration to set up.

```text
/code-graph-optimize
/code-graph-optimize Inline the single-use helper X
```

With no argument the command runs its default mission: find one genuinely dead
exported symbol, confirm it has zero inbound references, and remove it safely.

The command drives a find → confirm → edit → verify loop. It queries the graph
through this CLI (`dead-exports`, `references`, `who-calls`, `blast-radius`) to
gather context and confirm blast radius, makes exactly one edit, then runs
[`ts-knowledge-graph verify`](docs/commands/verify.md) — the type-check **and**
the test suite as a single gate. **If verify passes the edit stands; if it fails
the edit is reverted with `git restore`** and the change is abandoned or retried.
On a project with no test script verify degrades to type-check-only and the agent
says so, rather than implying the change was behaviourally verified. Run it on a
clean git tree so you can review (and `git checkout`) what it kept.

A companion command, `/code-graph-interview`
([`code-graph-interview.md`](dotclaude_folder/commands/code-graph-interview.md)),
is read-only: it interviews you to scope a measurable optimization target and
grounds each candidate in the graph, producing tasks you can then hand to
`/code-graph-optimize`. Both commands, plus the `code-graph-query` skill, live
under [`dotclaude_folder/`](dotclaude_folder) and are mirrored into `.claude/`.

To install all of them into another project, run
[`install`](docs/commands/install.md) from that project — it copies every
bundled command and skill into the project's `.claude/` directory:

```bash
npx ts-knowledge-graph install            # into ./.claude
npx ts-knowledge-graph install --force    # overwrite previously installed copies
```

                             find, …, verify, benchmark, report, webview, install)
  cli.ts                     wires the commands into the ts-knowledge-graph CLI
```

The optimization agent is not part of this `src/` tree — it is the
`/code-graph-optimize` Claude Code command under
[`dotclaude_folder/commands/`](dotclaude_folder/commands), which drives the same
queries through the CLI.

Node ids are derived purely from the declaration (`kind:relPath#name@line`), so
any extractor computes the same id for the same symbol without a shared
registry — that is what lets the semantic layer link a call site to the exact
declaration node the structural layer emitted.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Embedded query layer** — load into [Kùzu](https://kuzudb.com) (embedded,
  Cypher) with traversal tools: `who-calls`, `calls`, `blast-radius`,
  `dead-exports`, `neighbors`, `find`.
- [x] **Type edges** — `USES_TYPE`, `RETURNS`, `PARAM_TYPE` (plus `INSTANTIATES`)
  resolved through import aliases.
- [x] **Member-aware reference counting** — a class/interface is live when any
  contained member is referenced.
- [x] **Value-reference (`READS`) edges** — value-identifier usage, so exported
  `const`s (e.g. schemas) are no longer false-positive dead exports.
- [x] **Runtime enrichment** — the [`enrich`](docs/commands/enrich.md) command
  ingests a V8 CPU profile and attaches measured self time / sample count onto
  nodes as `metadata.runtime`, joining frames to nodes by enclosing range.
- [x] **Hotspot / leverage ranking** — the [`hotspots`](docs/commands/hotspots.md)
  command ranks nodes by optimization value (runtime self-time, fan-in,
  call-count, or transitive blast radius), defaulting to measured self time when
  enriched and degrading gracefully to static fan-in when not.
- [x] **Optimization agent** — the `/code-graph-optimize` Claude Code command,
  which proposes one edit and keeps it only if [`verify`](docs/commands/verify.md)
  (type-check **and** tests) passes (otherwise reverts with `git restore`).
- [x] **Test verification** — the [`verify`](docs/commands/verify.md) command runs
  the project's `typecheck` and `test` scripts as one keep/revert gate, so
  behavior-changing edits are caught, not just type errors. A project with no test
  script degrades to type-check-only, reported honestly (`behaviorVerified: false`).
- [x] **Benchmark verification** — the [`benchmark`](docs/commands/benchmark.md)
  command measures a target node's runtime metric (profile → enrich → cost) over
  N runs and reports the median + spread, with an advisory baseline→after delta —
  so an optimization is reported by its *measured* impact (e.g. −57% self-time on
  `titleCase`) rather than a guess. Advisory by design, distinct from the hard
  `verify` gate.
- [x] **Community detection** — the [`cluster`](docs/commands/cluster.md) command
  runs the Leiden algorithm (CPM) over the weighted coupling graph and attaches a
  module index onto nodes as `metadata.community`, with the internal-connectedness
  guarantee Louvain lacks.
- [ ] **Vector index** — embed per-node summaries for hybrid graph + semantic
  retrieval, so the agent can find candidates by meaning, not just by name.
