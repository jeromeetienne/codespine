# ts_knowledge_graph

Parse TypeScript source code into a **knowledge graph**, then use that graph as
the substrate for an autonomous AI agent that finds and applies code
optimizations.

## Documentation

Full documentation lives in [`./docs`](docs/INDEX.md). The
[documentation index](docs/INDEX.md) describes every guide and command — start
there, or jump straight to [Getting Started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Why a graph

An optimization agent constantly needs to reason about *blast radius*:

- *If I rewrite this function, who calls it and what breaks?* — `CALLS` edges
- *Is this export dead code I can delete?* — cross-file reference resolution
- *What is affected if I change this type?* — `USES_TYPE` / type-checker edges

These questions require **semantic** parsing (symbol + type resolution), which is
why the extractor is built on [`ts-morph`](https://ts-morph.com) (the TypeScript
Compiler API) rather than a syntax-only parser.

## Graph model

**Nodes** — `Module`, `Class`, `Interface`, `TypeAlias`, `Enum`, `Function`,
`Method`, `Property`, `Parameter`, `Variable`, `ExternalModule`.

**Edges**

| Layer | Edges |
| --- | --- |
| Structural | `CONTAINS`, `IMPORTS`, `EXPORTS` |
| Type | `EXTENDS`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `USES_TYPE`, `RETURNS`, `PARAM_TYPE` |
| Behavioral | `CALLS`, `INSTANTIATES`, `OVERRIDES`, `READS`, `WRITES` |

The structural layer is cheap and always emitted. The type + behavioral layers
require symbol resolution and are emitted with `--semantic`.

## Usage

```bash
npm install

# structural graph only (fast)
npm run extract -- <path-to-project>

# full graph with heritage + CALLS edges
npm run extract -- <path-to-project> --semantic
```

Output is two JSONL files — `outputs/graph/nodes.jsonl` and
`outputs/graph/edges.jsonl` (override with `--out`) — one record per line, easy
to inspect, diff, and load into any store.

### Querying the graph

Load the JSONL into an embedded [Kùzu](https://kuzudb.com) database, then run the
query tools:

```bash
npm run dev -- load        # reads ./outputs/graph, writes ./outputs/graph.kuzu

npm run dev -- find <name>                 # resolve a name to node ids
npm run dev -- who-calls <id>              # direct callers of a symbol
npm run dev -- calls <id>                  # what a symbol calls
npm run dev -- blast-radius <id> --depth 10  # transitive callers (impact set)
npm run dev -- references <id>             # everything that references a symbol/type
npm run dev -- dead-exports                # exported symbols with no inbound refs
npm run dev -- neighbors <id>              # one-hop neighbourhood (in + out)
npm run dev -- hotspots --by self-time     # rank nodes by optimization leverage
```

Every query command accepts `--json` to emit machine-readable output — this is
the shape the optimization agent consumes. Node ids come from `find` or another
query's results; do not hand-write them.

The query methods on `GraphQuery` (`whoCalls`, `blastRadius`, `deadExports`,
`hotspots`, `neighborhood`, …) are designed to map one-to-one onto agent tools:
JSON in, JSON out.

For a task-oriented walk-through of these commands — using them by hand to
answer impact, dead-code, and dependency questions — see the
[Static Analysis guide](docs/STATIC_ANALYSIS.md).

> **`dead-exports` accuracy:** it is member-aware (a class/interface counts as
> live when any contained member is referenced) and considers `CALLS`,
> `EXTENDS`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `USES_TYPE`, `RETURNS`, `PARAM_TYPE`, `INSTANTIATES`,
> and `READS` (value-identifier) edges. On this repository it reports exactly the
> two genuinely-unused type aliases — no false positives.

### Web visualisation

Serve the database as an interactive graph — pan/zoom, kind filters, symbol
search, per-node edge listing (see
[contribs/web_visualisation](contribs/web_visualisation)):

```bash
npm run web            # reads ./outputs/graph.kuzu, serves http://localhost:4173
npm run web -- --db ./outputs/graph.kuzu --port 8080
```

### The optimization agent

The end goal: an agent that uses the graph to find and apply optimizations,
verifying each one before keeping it. It ships as a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
slash command, `/code-graph-optimize`, defined in
[`dotclaude_folder/commands/code-graph-optimize.md`](dotclaude_folder/commands/code-graph-optimize.md)
— so the agent runtime is your Claude Code subscription, with no API key or
provider configuration to set up.

```text
/code-graph-optimize
/code-graph-optimize Inline the single-use helper X
```

With no argument the command runs its default mission: find one genuinely dead
exported symbol, confirm it has zero inbound references, and remove it safely.

The command drives a find → confirm → edit → verify loop. It queries the graph
through this CLI (`dead-exports`, `references`, `who-calls`, `blast-radius`) to
gather context and confirm blast radius, makes exactly one edit, then runs
`npm run typecheck`. **If type-checking passes the edit stands; if it fails the
edit is reverted with `git restore`** and the change is abandoned or retried.
Run it on a clean git tree so you can review (and `git checkout`) what it kept.

A companion command, `/code-graph-interview`
([`code-graph-interview.md`](dotclaude_folder/commands/code-graph-interview.md)),
is read-only: it interviews you to scope a measurable optimization target and
grounds each candidate in the graph, producing tasks you can then hand to
`/code-graph-optimize`. Both commands, plus the `code-graph-query` skill, live
under [`dotclaude_folder/`](dotclaude_folder) and are mirrored into `.claude/`.

## Architecture

```
src/
  schema/        Zod schemas for nodes and edges (the wire format)
  extract/
    project_loader.ts        load a ts-morph Project from tsconfig
    node_id.ts               deterministic, position-stable node ids
    structural_extractor.ts  modules, declarations, imports, containment
    semantic_extractor.ts    heritage, CALLS, INSTANTIATES, type edges
    graph_builder.ts         orchestrates extraction, dedupes by id
  store/
    jsonl_store.ts           serialize the graph to JSONL
    jsonl_reader.ts          read + Zod-validate the JSONL back in
    kuzu_store.ts            load the graph into embedded Kùzu, run Cypher
  query/
    graph_query.ts           the agent's query tools (who-calls, blast-radius…)
  commands/                  one file per CLI command (extract, load, query, web, install)
  cli.ts                     wires the commands into the ts-knowledge-graph CLI
```

The optimization agent is not part of this `src/` tree — it is the
`/code-graph-optimize` Claude Code command under
[`dotclaude_folder/commands/`](dotclaude_folder/commands), which drives the same
queries through the CLI.

Node ids are derived purely from the declaration (`kind:relPath#name@line`), so
any extractor computes the same id for the same symbol without a shared
registry — that is what lets the semantic layer link a call site to the exact
declaration node the structural layer emitted.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Embedded query layer** — load into [Kùzu](https://kuzudb.com) (embedded,
  Cypher) with traversal tools: `who-calls`, `calls`, `blast-radius`,
  `dead-exports`, `neighbors`, `find`.
- [x] **Type edges** — `USES_TYPE`, `RETURNS`, `PARAM_TYPE` (plus `INSTANTIATES`)
  resolved through import aliases.
- [x] **Member-aware reference counting** — a class/interface is live when any
  contained member is referenced.
- [x] **Value-reference (`READS`) edges** — value-identifier usage, so exported
  `const`s (e.g. schemas) are no longer false-positive dead exports.
- [x] **Runtime enrichment** — the [`enrich`](docs/commands/enrich.md) command
  ingests a V8 CPU profile and attaches measured self time / sample count onto
  nodes as `metadata.runtime`, joining frames to nodes by enclosing range.
- [x] **Hotspot / leverage ranking** — the [`hotspots`](docs/commands/hotspots.md)
  command ranks nodes by optimization value (runtime self-time, fan-in,
  call-count, or transitive blast radius), defaulting to measured self time when
  enriched and degrading gracefully to static fan-in when not.
- [x] **Optimization agent** — the `/code-graph-optimize` Claude Code command,
  which proposes one edit and keeps it only if `npm run typecheck` passes
  (otherwise reverts with `git restore`).
- [ ] **Test verification** — run the test suite alongside the type-check in the
  verify step, so behavior-changing edits are caught, not just type errors.
- [ ] **Vector index** — embed per-node summaries for hybrid graph + semantic
  retrieval, so the agent can find candidates by meaning, not just by name.
