// A repeatable benchmark workload for sample_projects/project_03: it drives the
// virtual-dispatch shape API under load so the V8 sampler catches the in-project
// hot frame (`describe`, plus the concrete `area` overrides).
//
// This file lives OUTSIDE the extracted source root so it never becomes a graph
// node. Imports are module-relative (not cwd-relative) so it runs from anywhere:
//
//   npx ts-knowledge-graph benchmark describe \
//     --workload scripts/benchmarks/project_03_workload.ts \
//     -o ./.ts_knowledge_graph/project_03 --root ./sample_projects/project_03
