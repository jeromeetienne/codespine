# Exercise every ts-knowledge-graph query tool against sample_projects/project_01.

# Builds the graph from scratch, then runs find / who-calls / calls / references /
# neighbors / blast-radius / dead-exports against real symbols in the project so
# each tool returns a meaningful, non-empty result, then enriches with a live CPU
# profile, ranks hotspots by measured self-time, and propagates that into
# inclusive cost with per-node causal attribution (cost). It closes on the two
# optimize-loop gates: verify (the hard type-check + test correctness gate) and
# benchmark (the advisory measured-impact gate, median + spread over N runs).
