# project_03 is a pure virtual-dispatch example, so this drill-down is deliberately

# targets the *abstract* `Shape.area` (no body, zero runtime). The real work is in
# the concrete overrides (Circle/Rectangle/Square.area), reached by dynamic dispatch
# the graph records as OVERRIDES — not the call target. So cost has nothing to flow
# into and the callee flow reads 0 ms: that zero is structural (a static-dispatch
# blind spot), not a profiling artifact.
