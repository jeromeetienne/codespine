# sample_projects

Small, self-contained TypeScript projects used to exercise and test
[`ts-knowledge-graph`](../README.md). See
[issue #21](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/ts_knowledge_graph/issues/21) for
the original motivation.

Each project is deliberately written to **need optimisation**, and the kind of
optimisation differs from one project to the next. That variety is the point:
running `ts-knowledge-graph` across the samples exercises a different layer of the
graph (structural / type / behavioral / system-level) and a different set of query
commands.

## The projects

| Dir | Name | Stresses | Dominant optimisation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`project_01`](project_01/) | `text-kit` | Structural layer — `EXPORTS`, `IMPORTS`, `READS` | Dead exports to delete (`dead-exports`) | ✅ done |
| [`project_02`](project_02/) | `calc` | Behavioral layer — `CALLS`, `INSTANTIATES` | Single-use helpers to inline (`who-calls`, `blast-radius`) | ✅ done |
| [`project_03`](project_03/) | `shapes` | Type layer — `EXTENDS`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `OVERRIDES`, `USES_TYPE`, `RETURNS` | Redundant override (`references`, `neighbors`) | ✅ done |
| [`project_04`](project_04/) | `lamp-capacity` | System-level layer — `Endpoint`/`HANDLES`, `ConfigFlag`, `ExternalAPI` (plus a `DimensionSimulator` interface for the type layer) | Fixture for the system-level kinds (`find`, `neighbors`, `references`) | ✅ done |

Together they cover all four graph layers (structural / type / behavioral /
system-level) and every query command. The first three each also carry one
*incidental* secondary optimisation so the samples stay realistic rather than
single-purpose; `project_04` is the system-level fixture for the #31 kinds — a
LAMP server capacity simulation, with a deterministic open-loop load generator in
`scripts/benchmarks/project_04_workload.ts` (issue #38).

## What every project contains

A common, predictable shape so the same commands work against each one:

```
project_XX/
├── README.md        # documents the planted optimisations and how to exercise them
├── package.json     # type:module — scripts: dev, test, typecheck
├── tsconfig.json    # ES2020 / NodeNext / strict, includes src + tests
├── src/
│   ├── main.ts      # non-exported main() — the runnable example, and the call-graph root
│   ├── index.ts     # public barrel
│   └── <subfolders> # the rest of the source, grouped into named folders
└── tests/           # node:test suites, run with tsx
```

Per-project scripts:

```bash
cd project_XX
npm run dev          # run src/main.ts
npm test             # npx tsx --test tests/**/*.test.ts
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
```

### A note on rooting the call graph

A leaf library has no in-graph callers of its own public API, and two things the
graph does *not* count as references would otherwise make every export look
dead:

- **barrel re-exports** (`index.ts`) are `EXPORTS` edges, not references; and
- **calls inside anonymous callbacks** (e.g. a `test('...', () => { ... })`
  body) are not captured as `CALLS` edges.

So each project roots its call graph through a **non-exported `main()`** in
`src/main.ts` that drives an internal consumer — mirroring how an application's
entry point keeps its public surface live. This is what makes a query like
`dead-exports` return *exactly* the deliberately planted orphans instead of the
whole public API.

## Exercising a project with ts-knowledge-graph

From the repository root, the quickest path is the per-project **tour** — it
rebuilds the graph from scratch and runs the query tools that project is built to
showcase, against real symbols:

```bash
npm run project01:tour      # structural layer: dead-exports + a single-use helper
npm run project02:tour      # behavioral layer: who-calls (incl. the dead case), calls, blast-radius
npm run project03:tour      # type layer: references / neighbors over EXTENDS / IMPLEMENTS / RETURNS
npm run project04:tour      # system-level + type layer, enrich, and the #38 load-generator verdict
```

Each project also has a `projectNN:*` script family for the individual steps —
`projectNN` (build + dead-exports), `projectNN:rebuild`, `projectNN:extract`,
`projectNN:load`, and one per query command (`:find`, `:who-calls`, `:calls`,
`:references`, `:neighbors`, `:blast-radius`, `:dead-exports`, `:web`). The
id-based ones take an argument after `--`:

```bash
npm run project02:find -- parseParenthesized
npm run project02:who-calls -- '<paste-id-from-find>'
```

All artifacts are written under `./outputs/project_NN/` (gitignored). See each
project's own `README.md` for the exact results to expect.
