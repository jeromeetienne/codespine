 * method override (an override uses the base member it replaces). Deliberately
 * excluded:
 * - `CONTAINS` / `IMPORTS` — containment and module wiring, not use;
 * - `EXPORTS` — marks a symbol as exported; counting it would give every export an
 *   inbound edge from its module and defeat dead-export detection;
 * - `WRITES` — mutating a binding is not using its value;
 * - `READS_CONFIG` — its target is a synthesized `ConfigFlag`, not a code symbol
 *   subject to dead-export analysis.
